This is the problem statement:

You need to design a parking lot system that supports the following requirements:

1. Types of Vehicles:
   * The parking lot should support different types of vehicles, such as motorcycles, cars, and buses.
   * Each vehicle type requires different parking space sizes.
2. Parking Slots:
   * The parking lot has a fixed number of parking slots of varying sizes.
   * A motorcycle can park in a small slot, a car in a medium slot, and a bus in a large slot.
   * Cars can also park in a large slot if no medium slots are available.
3. Ticket Generation:
   * When a vehicle enters the parking lot, a ticket should be generated with the vehicle's details and the time of entry.
   * The ticket should include the slot number where the vehicle is parked.
4. Payment:
   * The system should calculate the parking fee based on the duration of the parking.
   * Different rates apply to different vehicle types.
   * The user should be able to pay the fee and exit the parking lot.
5. Entry/Exit Gates:
   * The parking lot should have multiple entry and exit gates.
   * The system should handle the flow of vehicles efficiently.
6. Parking Slot Availability:
   * The system should keep track of the availability of parking slots and ensure that no two vehicles are assigned the same slot.
   * If the parking lot is full, the system should notify incoming vehicles that no slots are available.

Additional Considerations:
* The system should be scalable to handle a large number of vehicles and slots.
* It should handle edge cases such as multiple vehicles entering/exiting simultaneously.
* Consider future expansion, such as the ability to add more parking slots or introduce new vehicle types.
